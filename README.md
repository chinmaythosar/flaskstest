# flaskstest
FlaskTest API for Payment Processing

Required dependencies using pip:
flask, requests

How to Run:
$python3 api.py
$python3 tests.py

It should pass all tests.

Q: Gateway processing seems to not have any details. I could use a randomizer to invoke failures but
that seems hard to test without an actual test payment server or a testing API.

Note: Please check the query for testing a query or modify tests.py as necessary.
